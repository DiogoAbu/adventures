# Backend

This uses [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) to build an API with more flexibility and efficiency.

## Apollo

A production ready server, with caching, subscriptions, health checks and tons more.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language, so you can tell the API exactly the data you want to fetch.
